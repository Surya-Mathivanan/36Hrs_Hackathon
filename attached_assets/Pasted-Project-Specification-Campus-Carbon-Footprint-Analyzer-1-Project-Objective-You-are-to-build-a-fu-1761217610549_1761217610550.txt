Project Specification: Campus Carbon Footprint Analyzer
1. Project Objective
You are to build a full-stack, data-driven web application titled "Campus Carbon Footprint
Analyzer." The primary goal is to provide the KIT-KalaignarKarunanidhi Institute of
Technology administration and student body with a tool to quantify, track, analyze, and
reduce the campus's carbon footprint, in direct support of UN Sustainable Development
Goal 13 (Climate Action).
2. Core Technology Stack
This project MUST be built using the following technologies:
Frontend: React JS(pure react js without using tailwind css, typescript use only jSX)
Backend: Python (using the Flask framework)
Database: MySQL
Visualization: Chart.js or Recharts for interactive graphs.
Styling: A modern UI library (like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS) to achieve a professional,
dark-themed dashboard.
3. User Personas & Authentication
1.  Admin (Campus Staff):
Requires a secure username/password login.
Has full access to all modules.
Can: View the dashboard, add new data, edit/delete existing data.
2.  Public User (Student/Guest):
Does not require a login.
Has read-only access.
Can: Only view the main interactive dashboard and recommendations.
4. Database Schema (MySQL)
You must create the following tables:
1.  users
id (INT, Primary Key, Auto-Increment)
username (VARCHAR, Unique)
password_hash (VARCHAR)
2.  activity_data (This table stores all raw consumption data)
id (INT, Primary Key, Auto-Increment)
date (DATE) - The date the data was recorded for (e.g., '2025-10-01').
source_type (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'electricity', 'bus_diesel', 'canteen_lpg', 'waste_landfill'.
raw_value (DECIMAL) - The amount consumed (e.g., 120000).
unit (VARCHAR) - The unit of measurement (e.g., 'kWh', 'Liters', 'kg').
3.  emission_factors (This table stores the conversion factors)
id (INT, Primary Key, Auto-Increment)
source_type (VARCHAR, Unique) - Must match activity_data.source_type.
factor (DECIMAL) - The $kg$ $CO_2e$ per unit (e.g., 0.708).
factor_unit (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'kg_co2e_per_kwh'.
You must pre-populate the emission_factors table with values like:
('electricity', 0.708, 'kg_co2e_per_kwh')
('bus_diesel', 2.68, 'kg_co2e_per_liter')
('canteen_lpg', 2.93, 'kg_co2e_per_kg')
('waste_landfill', 1.25, 'kg_co2e_per_kg')
5. Backend API (Python/Flask)
You will build a REST API to handle all logic.
Calculation Logic: The core function of the backend is to fetch data from activity_data,
join it with emission_factors, and calculate the final emissions:
Total Emissions (tonnes) = (raw_value * factor) / 1000
API Endpoints:
POST /api/login: Authenticates an admin user (sets a JWT token).
POST /api/data (Admin Only): Adds a new entry to the activity_data table.
GET /api/dashboard: This is the main public endpoint.
It must accept query parameters for a date range (e.g., ?start_date=YYYY-MMDD&end_date=YYYY-MM-DD).
It must return a single JSON object containing all data needed for the dashboard
(KPIs, chart data, etc.).
GET /api/recommendations: Returns a list of suggestions based on simple logic (e.g., if
"electricity" is the highest source, return "Focus on LED lighting").
6. Frontend UI/UX (React JS)
The frontend must be a single-page application (SPA) with two main views:
A. Admin Data Input Page (/data-input)
Must be a protected route.
Must contain a clean, simple form with fields for:
Date
Source Type (Dropdown: Electricity, Bus Diesel, etc.)
Raw Value
Unit (Dropdown: kWh, Liters, etc.)
(Advanced) Include a file upload for CSV data.
B. Main Dashboard Page (/)
This is the public-facing view. It must be detailed, interactive, and visually match the
"final view" image provided in our chat.
Key Components:
1.  Date Range Selector: A dropdown/button group to filter the entire dashboard (e.g.,
"Last 6 Months," "Last Year").
2.  KPI Cards (4 cards):
Total Emissions: (e.g., "150 Tonnes $CO_2e$").
% Change: Compares Total Emissions to the previous period (e.g., "$\downarrow$
12% vs. Last Year").
Biggest Source: (e.g., "Energy (68%)").
Total Energy Saved: (e.g., "25,000 kWh").
3.  Line Chart (Historical Trend):
Title: "Total Emissions Trend"
Data: Shows the total $CO_2e$ (Y-axis) for each month (X-axis) in the selected date
range.
4.  Donut Chart (Emissions Breakdown):
Title: "Emissions Breakdown by Source"
Data: Shows the percentage split of total emissions (e.g., Energy: 68%, Transport:
25%, Waste: 7%).
5.  Grouped Bar Chart (Year-over-Year Comparison):
Title: "Monthly Emissions (Current vs. Last Year)"
Data: For each month (Jan, Feb, Mar...), it must show two bars side-by-side:
Emissions 2024 and Emissions 2025.
6.  Recommendation Panel:
A simple card that displays the suggestions fetched from the
/api/recommendations endpoint.
7. (Optional - Phase 2) AI/ML Integration
If time permits, you will add the following AI features:
1.  Predictive Forecasting:
Backend: Create a new endpoint /api/forecast.
Logic: Use the SARIMA time-series model (from the statsmodels Python library) to
train on the existing historical data.
Frontend: The Line Chart ("Total Emissions Trend") should be updated to show a
second, dotted line representing the forecasted emissions for the next 6 months.
2.  Automated Data Entry (OCR):
Backend: Create a new endpoint /api/upload-bill.
Logic: Use the Tesseract OCR library (via pytesseract) to scan an uploaded image (e.g.,
an electricity bill) and automatically extract the raw_value (kWh) and date.
8. Final Deliverables
1.  A complete, working full-stack application.
2.  The full source code in a GitHub repository.
3.  A README.md file with clear instructions on how to set up the database, install
dependencies (for both backend and frontend), and run the project.
4.  A schema.sql file to create the database structure.
